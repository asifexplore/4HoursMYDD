In 2017, I represented Singapore in a competition called Malaysia Developer Day, in short for MYDD. The competition took place in Cyberjaya, located south of Selangor, Malaysia. This annual competition easily attracts hundreds of participants from all over the world. The reason being, participants can efficiently connect with potential investors, obtain media coverage and potentially joining a start-up incubator or accelerator.

Representing Singapore, my team and I flew over from Singapore to pitch our idea. Our idea was simple, a platform to allow foreigners to enjoy local experiences which tourist attractions cannot mimic. An example would be, allowing users to taste the process of making a prata. Though the idea was simple, it had garnered a great deal of attention, from Start Up Incubators, Hackathon Judges and Investors.

In preparation for MYDD, we took part in numerous hackathons that took place in Singapore. But I hate to admit it, the event was on a completely different level compared to the hackathons we took part in Singapore. The scale was just different, from hundreds of participants to many noteworthy personals from various corporations. Throughout the competition, we made mistakes, were under tons of pressure, stress and were forced out of our comfort zones multiple times. We persevered till the very end of the competition. At the end of the day, we might not have won anything, however I met different kinds of people, experienced many different things which opened up my horizon and I am proud to say that it was an extremely worthwhile experience.
